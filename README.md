# Gold

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kelostrada/gold.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kelostrada/gold)

Opinionated interface to Bitcoin core JSON-RPC API. Currently in MVP mode: architecture is ready and stable, doesn't fully implement all of the RPC commands yet, although this would be trivial to do. Open an issue (or better yet, create a pull request) if you want to see more functionality added.

Documentation: http://hexdocs.pm/gold/

## Usage

Add Gold as a dependency in your `mix.exs` file.

```elixir
def deps do
  [ { :gold, "~> 0.10" } ]
end
```

After you are done, run `mix deps.get` in your shell to fetch and compile Gold. Start an interactive Elixir shell with `iex -S mix`.

```iex
iex> {:ok, pid} = Gold.start_link(%Gold.Config{hostname: "localhost", port: 8332, user: "bitcoinrpc", password: "changeme"})
{:ok, #PID<0.162.0>}
iex> Gold.getbalance!(pid)
#Decimal<9074.99999583>
iex> Gold.listtransactions!(pid)
[%Gold.Transaction{account: "", address: "mvZZq9C8ZiK85fLPL26N7n81D5jKu8SgcD",
  amount: #Decimal<12.50000226>,
  blockhash: "7e5ca54602567bec3fa7067344ae0916236e01d2c9f6cae80509b291f97edf0f",
  blockindex: 0, category: :immature, comment: nil, confirmations: 3, fee: nil,

  vout: 0}]
```

## Features

  * Uses the [Decimal](https://github.com/ericmj/decimal) library for representing BTC amounts, to avoid loss of precision;
  * Directly maps [Bitcoin's RPC functions](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#rpcs);
